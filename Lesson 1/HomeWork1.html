<h1>The Simpsons</h1>
<p> <h3>Bart</h3>
Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1) is the Deuteragonist of The Simpsons.
Bart is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood, disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child.
He is the only son of Homer and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been
nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics,
such as "Critical Hit", "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series
entitled the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother,
Mark Groening.

Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[5],
he has discovered a new comet which was named after him[6], and he also has performed in a successful band 
with Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.[7]
